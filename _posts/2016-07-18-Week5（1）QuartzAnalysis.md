Critique of An Interactive Project by Quartz

This project was published by Quartz in November 2014 and has been updated continuously. The name of the project is “This is every active satellite orbiting earth”. It is attractive at the first glance and does provide valuable information, but the data is not presented well enough. 

The design of the webpage is well-organized. The background is very simple, which is reasonable because the data is very huge. The designer chose to present the data in small dots, and illustrated the satellites based on their sizes- the one with a bigger size is a bigger dot, vice versa. And categorizing those dots in different colors tailors to the needs of the readers of Quartz - international readers who often have special interest in some countries. The project divides the space into “low earth orbit”, “medium earth orbit”, “geostationary orbit”, and “high earth orbit”, which perfectly illustrates the structure the space where all those satellites are in and how far away they are from the earth.  

I was impressed by the fact that the designers were able to process so much data and present every satellite by putting every dot on the webpage. And it is amazing that the designers located every dot, and readers can click on every dot and get some information about the satellites. 

However, the authors did not make the best use of the data, or the way the data is presented can be better. It is obvious that there are so many dots on the webpage. Though every dot has the information of every satellite, I don’t think readers will have the patience or time to click on every dot. That means, the majority of the data have been wasted. Furthermore, many dots overlapped each other. It’s hard to recognize them individually. And what if some readers are trypophobia (actually I’m sure some do)? 
To revise it, the designers can use some graphs or charts. For instance, use pie charts to illustrate which country has the most satellites. Or use a world map to put those dots in those countries and show it. Or the designers can present the satellites were installed chronologically.
