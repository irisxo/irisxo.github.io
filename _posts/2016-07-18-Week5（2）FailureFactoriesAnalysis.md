Critique of “Failure Factories” by Tampa Bay Times

“Failure Factories” is a project about how five schools in the Pinellas County in Florida have been turned into schools where students tended to fail. It analyzes the influence of the School Board’s decision to give up integration of the schools in the district. 

This project is very successful, especially because of the way that it visualizes the data. For instance, in the first story of the series - “Why Pinellas County is the worse place in Florida to be black and go to public school”, the “heat map” which first pops up shows that Pinellas County’s schools performed the worst among all the other counties in Florida. It later shows the geo-locations of the other seven schools also at the lowest level in terms of performance, and then illustrates the number of students and shows that Pinellas had four times as many students as the other seven schools all combined. These numbers are very small, but readers might not get what it really means. In contrast, the map offers a vivid demonstration, and gives a clear comparison. 

My favorite is the next part-the line graphs. Usually people use line graphs to show the changes. But the one here does not only illustrates how each school’s integration level changed through time, but also shows how the gap among the schools became bigger and bigger. And this is achieved by line graphs, which is very impressive. The map on the right side provides another visual presentation. The change of the color locations shows the situation got worse and worse. 

The animation of the graph is also worth mentioning. The highlight of the five most segregated schools in Pinellas is very straightforward, and it singles them out. This also gives more attention to those schools, which will be the main subjects to be discussed later. In my opinion, this is a very smart transition in the story. 

To set up a comparison, the designers listed the ten schools that had the similar failure level. And then they eliminated private schools, and two other kinds of underrepresented ones - schools for children who are disable or for those who have behavior problems-then five of the six elementary schools remained are from Pinellas County’s African American neighborhoods. 

The little kids icons are very useful in presenting the difference of performance between white students and black students. And how many of those icons to show first and what order to presenting those data are very important, too. 

To sum up, the “Failure Factories” has so many strengths. Other than the first story which I analyzed here, the rest of the other stories are also good examples for us to study.
