Credit and Housing Bubble in China? 

China's GDP rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter, in line with Wall Street's expectation, but many raise concerns over the sustainability of the country's economy epsecially over the potential credit and housing crisis. 

The second biggest economy in the world released its newest second-quarter results today. The gross domestic product in the first six months of 2016 reached 34,063.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.7 percent at comparable prices. But the growth is propped up by the still increasing credit level and the government's investment in various industries including constructions. 

Central bank is usually a country's leverage to adjust people's access to loans. In order to boost the economy, People's Bank of China sets a low interest rate so that developers and homebuyers will increase their housing purchases; when the economy needs to cool down, the central bank incerses the interest rate. 

But it seems that the credit level and real estate are over-heated in China. According to International Monetary Fund, 15 percent of the GDP, 15 percent of fixed asset investoment, 15 percent of urban employment and 20 percent of all bank loans are supported by real estate.

Even after China reported its GDP growth rate dipped to 6.9 percent for 2015, a 25-year low, the Chinese Communist Party leaders still choose to maintain its short-term target of at least 6.5 percent GDP growth by boosting credit creation. Many critized that the country is on the patch of credit addiction and sacrificing the long-term sustainablility of the economy. 

Many analysts also compared to China's current state to the U.S. before the 2008 Financial Crisis. 

George Soros, investor and chairman of Soros Fund Management, warned investors that the surging credit creation in China could lead to the real estate bubble to burst. 

"Most of the money that banks are supplying is needed to keep bad debts and loss-making enterprised alive," a reportd by Market Realist cited Soros. 

The National Bureau of Statistics of China's constructions data shows that state-owned companies are still devoting much investment to more buildings while the growth rate is much slower.

And compared to the floor space of buildings constructed by private enteprises, the state investment level is way higher.
