The google spreadsheet still shows that the dataset is too big when I tried to import the 2015 crime statistics. I failed several times again, so I just did the data sorting in Excel. 

I sorted out where the crimes happened. And then created a pie table in the newly-created Sheet 2 , which shows the number of crimes happened in the South, North, West and East sides of Chicago. I wanted to see whether it's like what it's said that most of the crimes are in South and West sides, it turned out to be true. 

The angle of the story that interests me would be exploring the reasons and current state of those areas and see whether there are new trends in terms of crimes.
