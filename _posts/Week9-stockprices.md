I analyzed the stock prices in the U.S. Exchange market. Technology related companies and financial corporations dominate the upper ladder of the ranking. Some stocks are doing much better or are overevaluated at this point. 

I extracted the data from barchart.com, a website provides stock prices related statistics, charts, analysis and opinions. The total statistics are 100 sets. Then I put them in a Google Sheet and created a chart analyse the pricevolume numbers. The chart is very easy to read, with the x axes indicating the companies, the y axes showing the price of the stocks. 

From the chart and the google sheet data, we can notice that technology related companies excel in the ranking, financial services corporations also stand out. Out of the biggest 15 companies in terms of price volume, eight are tech-related companies, including Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Alphabet Class C,
Alphbet Class A, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp. There are financial services and banks, which are Wells Fargo & Company, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. 

It's also very obvious there's a huge difference among the three stocks with the highest prices. The chart offers a more vivid and visual comparision.
